# NodeJS_Cheat-Sheet
My first intro to Node Js. This is a handy reference for some of the basics to get started with NodeJS.


## What is Node JS ?
Node JS is a Javascript runtime which allows us to run Javascript on the Server than on the Browser. It is built on V8 Javacript Engine by Google Chrome, written in C++.

## Why Node JS ?
* Node Js helps us to write Server-Side code in Javascript : to create server & listen to incoming request, handle requests, validate inputs & connect to database and finally to return responses.
* Node Js is fast, efficient & highly scalable to write production level code.
* Node Js is Event-Driven & has a Non-Blocking I/O Model, which is a huge advantage over other frameworks across the industry.

## Quick Guide 
* __firstNode.js__ : This is to demonstrate the working of *FS (File System) Module* which writes a message in a file (Text1.txt), the *Path Module* which is used to get the file path, directory name etc., and *HTTP Module along with Routing* to create & listen to server & running different routes. 
* __os_demo.js__ : This is to demonstrate the working of *OS Module*. It is very interesting one which finds all the core system information of the user including type of OS, CPU Architecture, Core Information, Machine Uptime and lot more.
* __route.js__ : This is to demonstrate the working of routes and the main working of NodeJS. Working with http routes, hitting different endpoints, understanding how requests & responses work, how to handle incoming request, parsing them, to write the incoming messages in a file, sending responses with HTTP Status codes & lots more.
